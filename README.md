# defenselessV1
Defenseless is a vulnerable web application written in PHP/MySQL. It is my first attempt at creating a vulnerable web application. Please let me know how this can be improved. The application would be regularly updated. This is the first version of this application. I would be soon updating it more bugs and a new vulnerable application is also being developed. The purpose of this application is to create security awareness among developers and new guys in application security.
